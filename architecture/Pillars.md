# Pillars of Architecture
Architecture can be broken into the following categories. These categories can help define what is well architected, and built for the future.

# Security
Security should be a top priority in any system. Security is a broad topic and evolving landscape. The exact implementation will vary over time but the core principles remain.

## Authentication and Authorization
Authentication is verifying the user or service principal is the user they claim to be.

Authorization is verifying the user has the permissions or privileges to perform the requested action.

## Data Encryption
Data Encryption is concerned with securing data so that is only readable by authorized parties.

## Network Security
Network Security is concerned with securing the network infrastructure and traffic.

## Secure Coding Practices
Secure coding practices are concerned with writing code that is secure by default.
