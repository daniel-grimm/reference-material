# Azure Certifications
Azure Certifications are great way to learn about the services Azure offers and how to use them alongside cloud development, DevOps, data, networking, and other subjects.

## Recommended Certifications
Below are the exams I have both taken and recommend:
- AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals
- DP-900: Data Fundamentals
- AZ-104: Azure Administrator
- AZ-305: Azure Solutions Architect

# AZ-900
This is a great introductory exam for non-technical folks or people who want to become familiar with how to take an Azure exam. The software that you use to take Azure exams can be somewhat confusing for a first-time test taker. I would recommend taking this as your first exam to learn the different ways in which you will be asked to answer questions (e.g. single select, multi-select, drag and drop etc.).

# DP-900
The Data Fundamentals certification is an introductory course to basic data concepts and data services in Azure. I think this is a terrific introduction to data and is light on the marketing materials aspect of a lot of foundational exams.

# AZ-104
The Azure Administrator certificate is a medium depth course that teaches you the services in greater detail and has an emphasis from an identity and governance perspective. Not only will you need to know how to use the common Azure offerings, but also how to do it in a way that is secure. Group membership and management, JIT credentials, and Least Privilege principles are all questions you can expect on the exam.

# AZ-305
This is a deep certification that teaches you how to interpret requirements and turn them into a quality solution. You must not only know the details of the services, but how they meet requirements across different segments including cost, redundancy, scalability, and more.

## Azure Certifications FAQ
### Should I tak the exam online or at a test center?
You should take the exam at a testing center. The software to take a test online can be over aggressive and cause issues during your test. If there is a technical issue at a testing center, there are trained professionals to assist you getting past any issues.

Additionally, testing centers will ensure that there are no distractions to help you focus on the exam.

### Should I take the Azure Fundamentals certification?
Yes, if this is your first Azure exam. Although the Azure Fundamentals exam is mostly marketing materials for Azure and Cloud development, there are still some reasons that this is worth your time and money.

1. Non-technical: This exam is non-technical, allowing anyone to be able to learn about Azure and achieve a cloud certification.
1. Exam format: The way you enter your answers changes every single question. You could encounter single-select, multi-select, drag-and-drop, dropdown, or other interfaces for answering questions. It's confusing and using a low-risk exam to learn how to answer questions can be good practice for the more intensive exams.
1. Time or Money Commitment: This is a cheaper, and less involved exam that can be passed relatively easily and cheaply if you are looking for a quick turnaround that doesn't impact your wallet.

### Which should I take? The Azure Administrator, or the Azure Developer?
You should take the Azure Administrator because the subjects in the exam will be encountered by every cloud developer. Azure Resource offerings, identity, governance, and permissions are all topics with which every cloud developer should be familiar.

The Azure Developer exam has an emphasis on niche, Azure specific tooling that you may not encounter at all in cloud development.
