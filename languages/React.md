# React
React is JavaScript framework developed by Facebook, now Meta, with a robust ecosystem of meta-frameworks and pacakges. The key differentiator from other frameworks at the time was the embracing of JSX which was a change in direction from existing platforms like Angular which had a different templating paradigm.

## Folder Structure
React is unopinionated and therefore a common complaint is how different projects are organized.

# Next.js
Next.js is a meta-framework for React that seeks to add structure and more functionality than is possible using pure React.
