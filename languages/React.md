# React
React is JavaScript framework developed by Facebook, now Meta, with a robust ecosystem of meta-frameworks and pacakges. The key differentiator from other frameworks at the time was the embracing of JSX which was a change in direction from existing platforms like Angular which had a different templating paradigm.

## Folder Structure
React is unopinionated and therefore a common complaint is how different projects are organized.

# Next.js
Next.js is a meta-framework for React that seeks to add structure and more functionality than is possible using pure React.

## Pages
Pages are handled two different ways in Next.js via file based routing, and through a new app router.

The older method for pages has been via file based routing using the `pages` directory, meaning, where the index file is in the folder structure, that will be automatically mapped to the website's URL.

The app router supports many of the same features as file based routing but uses the `app` directory.

## Layouts
Layouts are a great way to create a reusable format for your website. And you can have multiple formats to fit different screen sizes.
