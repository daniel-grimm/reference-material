Power Apps are Microsoft's no code / low code solution.

Power Apps comes in two main flavors Canvas apps, and Model Driven Apps.

# Canvas Apps
Canvas driven apps give the developer complete control over the UI and data of the application.

# Model Driven Apps
Model Driven Apps are more structured, where the user defines the data structure, before adding UI and additional controls, albeit in a more limited fashion than a Canvas app.
