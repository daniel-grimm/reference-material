Power Apps are Microsoft's no code / low code solution.

Power Apps comes in two main flavors Canvas apps, and Model Driven Apps.

Power Apps also have strong integration and automation capabilities. There are dozens of integrations with Teams, Outlook, Sharepoint, and non-Microsoft offerings that enable advanced capabilities. Power Automate can also be integrated to allow actions to occur automatically based on triggers.

# Canvas Apps
Canvas driven apps give the developer complete control over the UI and data of the application.

Canvas apps are being left behind in favor of the Model Driven architecutre due to the rigors of enforcing an object structure.

# Model Driven Apps
Model Driven Apps are more structured, where the user defines the data structure, before adding UI and additional controls, albeit in a more limited fashion than a Canvas app.

Model Driven Apps provide pre-packaged components that can be drag and dropped to create interactive forms to capture user data and insert it into Microsoft Datavers.

Models can have rules and validation applied using Business Rules. These rules are applied dynamically as the user goes through the form. These rules can be activated or deactivated separately from the columns to make the changes apply immediately.

What if you want to create complex data structures? Dataverse supports that! You can create Many-to-one and Many-to-Many relationships between tables to connect information together.

# Power Automation
Power Automation lets you create workflows using a library of plugins. Merely enter in a trigger condition, and fill out the parameters for each plugin and workloads will be automatically created.

These automations can be triggered manually, or automatically.

Most of the third party plugins require a premium (paid) tier of service, but even the Microsoft native plugins are pretty powerful.
