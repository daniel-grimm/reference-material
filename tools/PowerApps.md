Power Apps are Microsoft's no code / low code solution.

Power Apps comes in two main flavors Canvas apps, and Model Driven Apps.

Power Apps also have strong integration and automation capabilities. There are dozens of integrations with Teams, Outlook, Sharepoint, and non-Microsoft offerings that enable advanced capabilities. Power Automate can also be integrated to allow actions to occur automatically based on triggers.

# Canvas Apps
Canvas driven apps give the developer complete control over the UI and data of the application.

# Model Driven Apps
Model Driven Apps are more structured, where the user defines the data structure, before adding UI and additional controls, albeit in a more limited fashion than a Canvas app.

Model Driven Apps provide pre-packaged components that can be drag and dropped to create interactive forms to capture user data and insert it into Microsoft Datavers.

Models can have rules and validation applied using Business Rules. These rules are applied dynamically as the user goes through the form.
